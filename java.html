        <h1>Java</h1>
        <p>Java is a high-level, class-based programming language created by James Gosling and Mike Sheridan at Sun Microsystems. Known for its portability, Java’s “write once, run anywhere” philosophy is achieved through the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which allows Java programs to run on any platform. It’s widely used for enterprise applications, Android app development, and web services. Java’s strong type-checking, automatic memory management, and rich API make it a reliable choice for large-scale applications.</p>
