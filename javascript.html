        <h1>Javascript</h1>
        <p>JavaScript is a versatile, high-level scripting language primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic web content. Developed by Brendan Eich, it enables developers to enhance user interfaces and manage browser events with ease. As a core technology of the web alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript runs in browsers to execute client-side scripts and can be used on the server side through environments like Node.js. Its asynchronous programming capabilities and extensive libraries, such as React and Angular, drive modern web development.</p>
