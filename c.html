        <h1>C language</h1>
        <p>C is a foundational, general-purpose programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie. Renowned for its efficiency and performance, C provides low-level access to memory and system resources, making it ideal for system programming, embedded systems, and developing operating systems. Its simple syntax and minimal runtime make it a cornerstone of modern programming, influencing many other languages. Câ€™s robust set of operators and control statements allows for precise control over hardware and software.</p>
